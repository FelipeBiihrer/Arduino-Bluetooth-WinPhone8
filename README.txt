THIS PROJECT IS UPLOADED IN HOPES TO SEE SOMEONE FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY GET
A WINDOWS PHONE 8 DEVICE TO CONNECT TO AN ARDUINO UNO THAT USES THE SPARKFUN SILVER
MODEM BLUETOOTH MODULE. I GOT MINE FROM POLOLU.COM.

-------------------------
++ ARDUINO
-- POWER ON SPARKFUN MODEM
-- ALLOW SERIAL COMMANDS VIA ARDUINO MONITOR

++ WINDOWS PHONE 8
-- LIST PRE-PAIRED BLUETOOTH DEVICES
-- SUCCESSFULLY CONNECT TO PAIRED SPARKFUN BLUETOOTH MODULE

WHAT'S NEXT/MUST BE DONE?
-------------------------
++ SEND COMMANDS
-- TO SPARKFUN MODULE FROM WINDOWS PHONE 8 & TURN ON LED VIA RX/TX (or other method)

++ FILE SENDING
-- SEND FILE FROM ARDUINO TO WINDOWS PHONE 8
